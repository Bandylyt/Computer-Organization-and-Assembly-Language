## Installation

To set up your environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bandylyt/Computer-Organization-and-Assembly-Language.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Computer-Organization-and-Assembly-Language
   ```

3. **Install MASM/TASM**:
   - Download MASM or TASM from the provided tools folder.
   - Follow the installation instructions included in the respective folders.

4. **Check Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the necessary software installed to run the assembly programs. This may include an emulator for 8086 architecture.

## Usage

To use the tools and resources:

1. Open your preferred terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder of the lab or tool you want to use.
3. Follow the instructions in the README files located in each subfolder.

For example, to run a lab task, navigate to the `labs/lab1` folder and execute the provided assembly code using MASM or TASM.

## Lab Tasks

The lab tasks are designed to reinforce your understanding of assembly language programming. Each lab covers different aspects of 8086 architecture, such as:

- **Data Movement**: Learn how to move data between registers and memory.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Implement basic arithmetic operations using assembly.
- **Control Flow**: Understand how to use jumps and loops effectively.

### Lab 1: Data Movement

In this lab, you will learn how to transfer data between registers. The goal is to write a simple program that moves data from one register to another and displays the result.

### Lab 2: Arithmetic Operations

This lab focuses on performing arithmetic operations. You will write programs to add, subtract, multiply, and divide using assembly language.

### Lab 3: Control Flow

In this lab, you will explore control flow statements. You will learn how to implement conditional statements and loops in your assembly programs.

## Finals Practice

Preparing for finals can be daunting. This repository includes practice materials to help you get ready:

- **Practice Exam 1**: Covers basic concepts of assembly language.
- **Practice Exam 2**: Focuses on advanced topics and problem-solving.

Each practice exam includes questions that mimic the format and difficulty of actual exams. Review the materials thoroughly to enhance your understanding.

## Architecture Theory

Understanding computer architecture is crucial for mastering assembly language. This section includes resources on:

- **8086 Architecture**: Learn about the internal structure of the 8086 microprocessor.
- **Memory Management**: Understand how memory is organized and accessed.
- **Input/Output Operations**: Explore how the CPU interacts with peripherals.

You can find the architecture theory document in the `theory/` folder. This document will provide you with a solid foundation in computer organization.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers a variety of topics related to assembly language and computer organization, including:

- 8086 Architecture
- 8086 Emulator
- Assembly Language Programming
- COAL (Computer Organization and Assembly Language)
- Emulation Techniques

These topics are essential for anyone looking to deepen their knowledge in computer science and programming.
